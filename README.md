I wrote all the code here with inspiration and help from the tutorial that my teacher made for MovieCRUDLite, my teacher is Eric Pogue. 
HTML code with linked Javascript and CSS files. They utilize a mongoDB database to create a database that create,reads,updates, and deletes movies and comments from users.
